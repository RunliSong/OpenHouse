<h1>★ Overview ★</h1>

<p style="text-align:center">Open House Geelong is a not-for-profit association run by a dedicated group of volunteers set up to hold an event that provides the public a free and rare opportunity to discover a hidden wealth of architectural and historic buildings in Geelong. In its first year, the team hopes that Open House Geelong will become a successful and growing annual event on the Geelong events calendar. The inaugural Open House Geelong event is being held on 10th November 2012. An exciting list of public and private buildings in Central Geelong to “unlock” for the event has been secured. The buildings will reflect our rich past, celebrate our present and offer insights into the future of Geelong.</p>
